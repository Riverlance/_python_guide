# Scope

# Variables defined inside a function are local by default.

# Variables defined outside a function are global; or, if accessed inside a function using the `global` keyword, they are treated as global.

# Variables defined inside a function using the nonlocal keyword are nonlocal, which refers to the nearest enclosing function (`inner()` gets `x` (8) of `outer()` on the nonlocal scope example).
# This means they are not local to the inner function (`inner()` on the nonlocal scope example), nor global, but belong to the nearest enclosing function scope (`outer()` on the nonlocal scope example).
